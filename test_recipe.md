# Test Recipe

## Ingredients:
1 pack of instant noodles (flavor of your choice, surprise yourself!)
2 cups of water (or however much you feel like, who measures?)
A sprinkle of leftover courage (optional)
1 spoon of desperation (adjust to taste)
A dash of existential crisis (for extra flavor)
Whatever random stuff is in your fridge (seriously, just grab anything)

## Instructions:
Boil the water in a pot (or microwave it, we’re not here to judge).
Dump the noodles into the water. Watch them swirl like your hopes and dreams.
Stir occasionally while contemplating your life choices.
Add the flavor packet, because that’s where the magic happens.
Spice it up with that random stuff from your fridge—mystery leftovers, half a carrot, or even that weird jar of olives.
Stir everything together and let it simmer until your hunger is unbearable.
Serve in the fanciest bowl you have to elevate the experience. Sprinkle with a pinch of your dwindling optimism.
Enjoy in front of the TV while binge-watching a show you’ve seen 100 times.
